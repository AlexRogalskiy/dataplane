# Dataplane
Dataplane is the super fast, cloud native, scalable, secure and easy to use data platform for data-driven businesses. 

# Development
We setup a containerised environment in VS code using docker-compose. The idea is to have a simple setup that could simulate a Containerised/Kubernetes setup for basic development in either Mac, Windows or Linux dev environment. 

To run follow these steps
1. Install Remote Development in VS Code - extension id: ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack
2. Click on the green section with two chevrons bottom left corner of VS code "Open a remote window"
3. Ensure Docker is running
4. Click on "Reopen in Container" 
5. To work outside of the container, click on the green section again and select "Reopen Folder Locally"


# License

The project is released under the Source Available License - Business Source License 1.1 (BSL). We chose this license because we didn't want cloud providers to offer this project as a data platform service. If you would like to offer Dataplane as a service, we would likely want to be involved in your venture so come speak to us first. For the 99.999% of you who are using the software for your own personal or business needs, you can use the software freely where these restrictions will not apply. 

Thanks to Vectorized (https://vectorized.io/blog/open-source/), CockroachDB and Mariadb for the careful research into this topic. We share the same views on striking a balance between making software open to the community while being protected from unfair practices that aim to commercially benefit without giving back to the community.
