# About the project
The idea behind Dataplane is to make it quicker and easier to build robust data pipelines and automated workflows for businesses and teams of all sizes. In addition to being more user friendly, there has been an emphasis on scaling, resilience, performance and security. It is early days for Dataplane with the first beta release. We would love to hear your thoughts and for you to get involved. 

# Quick start
Once running, visit the dashboard at http://localhost:9000/webapp/<br /><br />
First time setup: http://localhost:9000/webapp/get-started

# Development
We setup a containerised environment in VS code using docker-compose. The idea is to have a simple setup that could simulate a Containerised/Kubernetes setup for basic development in either Mac, Windows or Linux dev environment. 

To run follow these steps
1. Install Remote Development in VS Code - extension id: ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack
2. Click on the green section with two chevrons bottom left corner of VS code "Open a remote window"
3. Ensure Docker is running
4. Click on "Reopen in Container" 
5. To work outside of the container, click on the green section again and select "Reopen Folder Locally"
