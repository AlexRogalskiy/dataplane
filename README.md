# License

The project is released under the Source Available License - Business Source License 1.1 (BSL). We chose this license because we didn't want cloud providers to offer this project as a data platform service. If you would like to offer Dataplane as a service, we would likely want to be involved in your venture so come speak to us first. For the 99.999% of you who are using the software for your own personal or business needs, you can use the software freely where these restrictions will not apply. 

Thanks to Vectorized (https://vectorized.io/blog/open-source/), CockroachDB and Mariadb for the careful research into this topic. We share the same views on striking a balance between making software open to the community while being protected from unfair practices that aim to commercially benefit without giving back to the community.
