On startup this will download the files from distributed file system.

0. All saved file syncs should happen before this download to ensure no changes - a sync log should be kept to check, wait for sync to finish?
1. Get all the pipelines that are associated with this worker - this will be derived from nodes because a node can be associated with a single worker.
2. Batch pipelines for download - batches of 10 default
3.

This method may not be used because it would be better to download the files on pipeline run, the first run might be a bit slow but will speed up with known cache
